    Note right of browser: The server responds with almost similar html-document as in the traditional web-app example. The difference is the javascript-file spa.js and small change in the definition of the Form-tag.<br/> In this case there are no action- or merhod-attributes.

    Note right of browser: The browser starts executing the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server.<br/> In the single-page app case the javascript code contains also functions for redrawing the notes when the user adds a new note to the server and also a function for sending the new note to the server.
